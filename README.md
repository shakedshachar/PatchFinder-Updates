## Features

### AI-Powered Search (Natural Language)
Just type something like:

> “quirky comedy cue” or “epic Viking battle”

PatchIO will:
- Understand your musical intent
- Generate smart keywords
- Auto-fill `OR / AND / NOT` filters in the Advanced tab

### Simple Mode
For lightning-fast searches:
```plaintext
celesta quirky
"soft piano" pizzicato
"bamboo flute" kalimba
```

### Advanced Mode
Use structured keyword logic:
- `or:` – any of these keywords
- `and:` – must include all
- `not:` – must exclude these

### Keyword Highlights in Results
Get smart visual hints like:
```
📁 Epic Battle Drums           ➤ "tribal percussion" "war horns"
📁 Nordic Strings              ➤ "tagelharpa" "ancient pluck"
```

## Filtering, File Types & Folders

### File Extension Filter
Search only:
- `.nki` (Kontakt)
- `.wav`, `.aif`
- `.patch`, `.preset`, etc.

### Excluded Folders
Add folders to skip (e.g., “Backups”, “Old Projects”) to keep results clean.

## AI + Offline Hybrid
-  AI Search requires internet
-  Simple + Advanced modes work 100% offline
