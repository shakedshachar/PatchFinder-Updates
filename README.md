## 🧠 Features Overview

### AI Search (Natural Language)

Just type a musical brief like:

```
quirky comedy cue  
epic Viking battle
```

PatchIO uses AI to:
- Understand your intent
- Suggest smart keywords
- Populate the Advanced tab with OR / AND / NOT filters

You can still tweak the search terms afterward.

---

### Simple Mode

Quickly search using basic keywords like:

```
celesta quirky
```

💡 Use quotes around multi-word phrases to match exactly:

```
"soft piano" pizzicato quirky "bamboo flute"
```

---

### Advanced Mode

For precision searches using:

- `or:` – at least one of these keywords
- `and:` – all of these must appear
- `not:` – exclude if these appear

---

### 🔍 Keyword Highlights in Results

Matched folders show smart tags like:

```
📁 Epic Battle Drums           ➤ "tribal percussion" "war horns"
📁 Nordic Strings              ➤ "tagelharpa" "ancient pluck"
```

This helps you understand why each folder matched your search.

### 🔎 Filter Results Box

Filter your search results even further using keyword filtering.
